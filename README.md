# IGEEK

The Interactive Gym Environment and Educational Kit (IGEEK) is a toolkit for developing AI solutions. This app used to be in Java and is only half ported; sorry for the inconvenience. The new version uses a HTML5/JavaScript/React interface.

## Mission and Vision

The mission of IGEEK is to use mimicry sciences to help make better AI solutions. Our vision is to use mimicry in some bizarre ways to create awesome things; we envision you saying: "that is weird; I love it!".
