The Leukocyte Wars
==================

The Leukocyte Wars is an abstract simulation of a human body on the cellular level with quasi-robotic white blood cell that fight off infectious genetic viruses. The goal of the simulation is for either the viruses to kill the host, the host to kill the viruses, or for the two to maintain a symbiotic relationship.  The purpose of the simulation is to teach the basic concepts of genetic programming, genetic algorithms, artificial intelligence, computer vision, biomimicry, and robotics programming.
