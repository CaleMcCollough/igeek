Welcome to the Cell IGA  wiki!. The Cell Interactive Genetic Algorihm is an application of biomimicry in computer science. It is abstract simulation of the human body immune system on the cellular level with quasi-robotic white blood cells that fight off genetically modified retroviruses. The goal of the simulation is for either the viruses to kill the host, the host to kill the viruses, or for the two to maintain a symbiotic relationship.

This project is ongoing research in computer science and engineering and is currently in its early stages. The goal of the experiment is to innovate on classical genetic algorithm and programming techniques by mimicking the way that the human body rights off infections and cancerous cells. Traits identified as undesirable (i.e. viruses and cancer) will illicit an Autoimmune response that will force the undesired trait to evolve or die, potentially allowing for a more sophisticated fitness function generation.

Currently there isn't a whole lot to see. I am developing a 2D genetic shape matching algorithm. The Cells and White Blood Cells have not been implemented. I do have a simple software rendered 3D graphics engine that I will be implementing sometime in the near future. The goal is then to move from 2D into 3D, and then from 3D into solving complex mathematical equations. If you would like to know more, please check out the [[Simulation Overview]].
